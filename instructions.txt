This project will be a open source facebook clone. I want to build the frontend in Next.js and connect it to a backend in Supabase. I will deploy it to Vercel, and for styling I want to use MaterialUI. Please help me with laying out the basic foundation of this website.

Minimal requirements (but please add if you think I forgot something):

- the site has a sidebar left in screen
- the site is built in Next.js using "next": "15.5.6", "next-pwa": "^5.6.0",
- the site will include a progressive web app PWA
- the site does not use Turbopack
- the site connects with Supabase and hides any secure information in .env.local
- the site is ready to connect to google analytics and vercel analytics
- users can sign up, create a profile and log in
- users can upload a profile picture
- users can change their profile
- users can change their profile picture, and when they do their new picture will be visible in all their posts (from before and after the change)
- users can post updates on their own profile feeds
- users can upload pictures to their profile page in an album, to include in posts
- updates show the avatar of the user, their display name, and a relative date (eg. 2 days ago)
- users can comment on posts
- users can like posts and comments (max 1 time per post)
- users can choose the visibility of their posts (anyone, friends only, etc)
- there is a floating action button in the bottom right of the screen to a new post input field
- users can attach photos's and weburls to their posts
- users can connect with friends
- users can send private messages to friends
- users can create groups and invite people to join them
- users can search available groups and send a request to join to the owner or moderators
- users have an inbox with notification (for example to get noticed when they recieve a new friend request)
- users have a home feed that shows the latest posts from friends by default, but users can choose to switch to latest public posts from non-friends instead
- when scrolling down and the end of a post list is reached, the next posts are fetched in an infinite scroll

Please create this in main steps:

Step 1 - create the Next.js site and include the PWA
Step 2 - tell me how to connect to Supabase, what to activate and what tables to create
Step 3 - build the frontend on top of this schema architecture
